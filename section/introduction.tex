In this work, we accurately localize and track a user's position in 
a given space using 60GHz radios.
The multi-Gbps throughput potential of 60 GHz wireless interfaces make them an 
attractive technology for next-generation gigabit WLANs.
Previous works have focused on localizing the user either using legacy
WiFi (2.4/5 GHz) which are not very accurate or using IR sensors, LEDs, cameras which requires installation of 
additional hardware.
In this work, we show that by just using PHY layer information i.e. Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) which can be
obtained without any modifications to the firmware,
we can accurately localize the user and also track their motion.
% Instead of choosing 802.11ac's
%reliability over 802.11ad's performance or vice-versa, we propose
%engaging both technologies simultaneously. 
%Using both 802.11ad and
%802.11ac interfaces simultaneously not only offers reliability by
%providing a fall-back option in case 60 GHz connectivity
%becomes unavailable but also allows a client to theoretically obtain
%the sum of the data rates offered by the two technologies. 
%Recent commercial 802.11ad NICs~\cite{intel11ad, qca11ad} include an 802.11ac radio on the same chipset. 
%Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)
%APs as well as client devices offer tri-band solutions with 2.4, 5, and 60 GHz
%interfaces and thus such a multi-band approach is

% without any extra hardware.
%However, realizing such a combined 802.11ad-ac interface, made up of
%two rather heterogeneous technologies, comes with it's own set of
%challenges. For instance, such a bundling of interfaces needs to done
%in a manner that is transparent to user applications without requiring
%any changes to them. Also, since most applications rely on TCP as the
%choice of transport protocol, any proposed solution needs to offer
%reliable in-order-delivery end-to-end data transfer service.
%A critical architecture choice 
%towards such a solution 
%is at which layer of the protocol stack to implement such a solution.

Specifically, we explore Multipath TCP (MPTCP), a transport layer
protocol that uses the 802.11ad and 802.11ac interfaces simultaneously
to achieve higher throughput when both networks are available, and
seamlessly falls back to 802.11ac in an application-transparent manner
when the 802.11ad network becomes unavailable. Commercial
off-the-shelf (COTS) APs and client devices offer tri-band solutions
with 2.4, 5, and 60 GHz interfaces and thus such an approach is
feasible with existing hardware.

%MPTCP's design as a transport layer solution

%alternative to single-path TCP (SPTCP), 
%decouples it from other layers.

%application layer and the IP and MAC layers.
%; thus, a solution
%built around MPTCP can evolve independently from and work with any
%future 802.11 standards in the 5 GHz or 60 GHz space (e.g., 802.11ax
%or 802.11ay, respectively). 

Nonetheless, using MPTCP in multi-band WLANs
is far from straightforward.
%A large number of recent studies
%investigated the performance of MPTCP in scenarios combining WiFi and
%cellular (3G/LTE) networks
%(e.g.,~\cite{raiciu:nsdi2012,saha:mobiwac2017}) 
%and showed that the
%protocol performs poorly over heterogeneous paths.
% due to interactions
%among out of order TCP packets, scheduling decisions, congestion
%control, and limited receiver buffer size.
%Given
%the large bandwidth disparity between sub-6GHz and 60 GHz WiFi, it
%is likely that MPTCP will suffer from similar problems in these
%networks. 
Recent works that studied MPTCP performance in dual band 5/60 GHz
WLANs
showed that using MPTCP often results in lower performance than using
the 802.11ad interface alone and 
%The authors in~\cite{sur:mobicom2017,nguyen:vtc2017} 
%Some previous works
some even argue that the two radios should never be used
simultaneously.

To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to show that the
use of MPTCP is not just a viable but a very promising solution
towards dual-band 5/60 GHz WLANs.
%We conduct an experimental
%study using COTS APs and laptops with the goal 
%of not only exploring
%the performance of MPTCP in dual-band 802.11ad/ac WLANs, but also
%of understanding the causes of the observed performance and uncovering the
%pitfalls of the current MPTCP implementation in this new setting.
Our experimental study, using COTS APs and laptops, reveals that 
%a few recently introduced optimizations in the
%MPTCP scheduler, while effective in scenarios
%involving WiFi/cellular interfaces, result in suboptimal performance in 802.11ad/ac
%scenarios, and disabling them yields near
MPTCP provides nearly optimal performance under baseline, static scenarios -- 96-99\% of the sum of the throughputs achieved when using each of the two interfaces alone.

We experimented with 
%four 
different congestion control algorithms 
%available in the
%Linux MPTCP implementation: \emph{Cubic} (decoupled), \emph{Lia}, 
%\emph{Olia}, and \emph{Balia} 
under backlogged
traffic and found that for each of 
%the four 
these
algorithms,

%We found that

%can indeed achieve performance very close to the expected sum} (at

However, realistic dynamic environments, e.g., 802.11ac contention or 
blockage of the 802.11ad link, 
%are extremely challenging for

MPTCP scheduler that addresses the root-cause of the performance
degradation.

Our evaluation in real
indoor WLAN scenarios shows that \name can achieve up to \textbf{2.5x}
throughput improvement and can reduce application-level delay by several
10s of seconds compared to the default MPTCP.

%We show that how MPTCP's architecture and optimizations introduced to

performance in dual-band 802.11ad/ac WLANs with COTS devices under
realistic settings.

%(2) We develop a comprehensive set of tools to instrument MPTCP
%components, like the queues and scheduler, that help us understand the
