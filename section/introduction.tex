In this work, we accurately localize and track a user's position in 
a given space using 60GHz radios.
The multi-Gbps throughput potential of 60 GHz wireless interfaces make them an 
attractive technology for next-generation gigabit WLANs.
Previous works have focused on localizing the user either using legacy
WiFi (2.4/5 GHz) which are not very accurate due to the presence of extensive multipath or using IR sensors, 
LEDs, cameras which requires installation of 
additional hardware.
In this work, we show that by just using PHY layer information i.e. Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) which can be
obtained without any modifications to the firmware,
we can accurately localize the user and also track their motion.

We use a probabilistic model to determine the user's location based on the SNR values obtained. 
Our probabilistic model is based on particle filters which results in a non-parametric distribution
and hence can represent a broad set of distributions rather than just a single distribution (as is the case in
parametric distribution methods). Our model results in a set of locations/paths and their probabilities.

We evaluate the system on a set of randomly generated locations and paths from the given space and
achieve an x\% accuracy in detecting the locations and a y\% accuracy in detecting the path of a user.
