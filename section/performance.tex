%We first experimented with four congestion control algorithms available in the
%Linux MPTCP implementation: \emph{Cubic} (decoupled), \emph{Lia}, 
%\emph{Olia}, and \emph{Balia} under backlogged
%traffic and found that for each of the four algorithms, \textit{MPTCP
%can indeed achieve performance very close to the expected sum} (at
%least greater than 96\% and up to 99\%). 
To explain the reasons for the nearly optimal performance, we turn our
attention to a key MPTCP component: the packet-scheduler. We design an
MPTCP scheduler that assigns packets to the two interfaces based on a
user-defined ratio, in order to understand how the traffic
distribution between the subflows impacts MPTCP performance.

Fig.~\ref{fig:ratio_tput} plots the MPTCP throughput against the
number of packets assigned to the 802.11ad subflow ($Pkts_{ad}$) out
of every 100 packets.

%We vary $Pkts_{ad}$ between 5 to 95 (with a step
%of 5) to cover the entire range of possible assignment ratios. In each
%case, the remaining packets (out of 100) are assigned to the 802.11ac
%subflow ($Pkts_{ac}=100-Pkts_{ad}$).
We find that maximum throughput

% with the worst throughput being as low as 400 Mbps ($Pkts_{ad}=5$).

We found that the stark difference in performance with different % stark??
assignment ratios is a result of the degree to which packets arrive
\textit{out-of-order} in the end-to-end MPTCP flow. 
\fi
%due to the specific distribution of traffic among the subflows.
%A higher number of out-of-order packets can cause
%packets to be buffered in the receiver's \emph{ofo-queue} and in
%extreme cases can even result in throttling of the sender because of
%limited/no space in the receiver's buffer. 
%In fact, in
%Fig.~\ref{fig:ratio_tput_ofo_delay}, which plots the CDF of the delay
%experienced by bytes in the \emph{ofo-queue}, we observe that
%the $Pkts_{ad}=77$ value (that results in highest throughput) indeed
%yields the lowest delay. 
%Moreover, we observe that in general the
%$Pkts_{ad}$ values that result in high delay are the ones that result
%in lower throughput and vice-versa. 
\if 0
We also plot the CDF of the
occupancy of the \emph{ofo-queue} under different $Pkts_{ad}$
values in fig. \ref{fig:ratio_tput_ofo_len}. Here, one might expect to
see a similar behavior as the delay where the queue lengths are smaller
(indicating less out-of-ordering) for packet assignments that yield
higher throughputs. However, under extreme $Pkts_{ad}$ values
(e.g, 5, 95), the traffic distribution is so skewed towards one of
the subflows that almost all the packets flow through one of
the interfaces, thereby significantly reducing the chance of having an
in-sequence packet being delayed over the other interface. As a result
extreme $Pkts_{ad}$ values (5, 95, 15, 85 15), although sub-optimal
throughput-wise, have queue lengths smaller than the one of the $Pkts_{ad}=77$ case.
Excluding the extremes, other $Pkts_{ad}$ values show a general trend of
having larger queues in conjunction with lower throughputs values.
\fi
We observe that the throughput-optimal packet assignment ratio is
identical to the ratio of the actual individual throughputs of the two
interfaces. Assigning packets in this ratio minimizes the chance of
packets arriving out-of-order at the meta-level MPTCP buffers. We also
observe that performance worsens sharply as we move away from this
value.
\if 0
\noindent\textbf{Throughput-optimal ratio.} $Pkts_{ad}=77$ results in optimal throughput as the
the underlying packet-distribution ratio imposed by this assignment
$Pkts_{ratio}=Pkts_{ac}/Pkts_{ad}=23/77=0.29$ is nearly identical to
the ratio of the actual individual throughputs of the two interfaces
$Tput_{ratio}=Tput_{ac}/Tput_{ad}=500/1600=0.31$. Assigning packets in
this very specific ratio minimizes the chance of packets arriving
out-of-order at the meta-level MPTCP buffers/queues. 
\fi
\if 0
Note that
although in-order delivery of packets within a subflow (intra-subflow)
is guaranteed because of single path TCP (SPTCP) operation at the subflow level,
global in-order delivery among all subflows (inter-flow) needs
to be achieved through re-ordering at the meta-level.
